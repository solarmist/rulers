As I've been reading this there is some mixed messages on who the target
audience is.  For example, you use map with only a passing comment, but explain
negative indices and what CRUD is in the next few pages, but I believe the
target audience is people that have created couple of small or a single medium
rails apps.  To me this reads as if it is targeting a beginner (one programming
class in a scripting language, prefferably Ruby) with no web or professional
expereince, but with bits here and there of assumed knowledge (like rails
directory structures, or how to insert a variable in erb html etc).  With a bit
of editing and expanding to clarify the target audience this book could clearly
target a first web exposure audience.  The In Rails sections are the only ones that assume Rails experience as best I can tell (since a lot of them are over my head).

Chatper 3
Starting from chatper 3 you switch to directing readers to use the github, but
in chapter 2 you explain to make all the changes, such as incrementing the
version file (and talk about incrementing it each chapter).

Page 40, para 2 "bit harder to redirect that a normal redirect" => "than than a
normal redirect"
para 3 "number bare" => "bare numbers"

Page 45 Needed to reinstall rulers before I could "rackup -p 3001", but
couldn't get "bundle exec rackup -p 3001".  You need to specifiy if you're
showing the entire file or just a snippit.

Page 49 you need to do a 'bundle install' before running
'bundle exec rerun -- rackup -p 3001', also on 10.9/ruby 2 I get
".rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247/gems/rerun-0.8.1/lib/rerun/watcher.rb:62:in
`block in start': undefined method `start!' for
#<Listen::Listener:0x007f89b42e0f28> (NoMethodError)".  Listen version 2
removes start! which rerun relies on listen 1.3.1 and hasn't been updated for
listen 2.0.0.

Page 56 The comment at the top of the ERB file has a ruby style comment at the
top instead of an HTML comment

Page 66 you should at some point mention bundle <=> bundle install.  The quote in the json should be //

Page 68 Why a bare rescue instead of FileNotFound?

P 69 Comment should be HTML style also

P 72 Comment should be //
        ["submitter", "quote", "attribution"].each do |key|
          hash[key] = attrs[key] || ""
        end
is a much nicer way of assigning the hash (since you're assuming a some
facility with Ruby and using map in the next line)
how about
    b.gsub(".json", "").to_i instead of the slice b.[0..-5]

P 76 Exercise Two is a bit unclear in its goal, what do you want the reader to actually do?  It sounds more like a mini-discussion that mentions something you could do in the middle more than an exercise.  It should be clear when you're done with an exercise.

P 85 Exercise One is unclear in it's wording and seems to leave an incomplete solution once implemented, since Rails uses class variables for passing variables, but out quotes app is just using them directly.
